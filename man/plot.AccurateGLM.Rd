\usage{
\method{plot}{AccurateGLM}(
  model,
  vars = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  s = NULL,
  resid = TRUE,
  ask = TRUE,
  layout = c(2, 2),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An AccurateGLM object.}

\item{vars}{An integer or character vectors (indices or names) specifying which variables should be plotted.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, outputs details.}

\item{s}{A numeric value specifying lambda value at which plotting is required.
Note that this function can't plot for multiple lambda values, so it allows only
single \code{s} value (which means \code{model} is trained with multiple lambda values and plot with one of them),
or \code{s=NULL} (which means \code{model} is trained with single lambda value and plot with that value).}

\item{resid}{A boolean value which indicates plot residuals.}

\item{ask}{A boolean value which indicates ask if go to next plot.}

\item{layout}{A pair of integer values which indicates how many plots are drawn rawwise and columnwise respectively.}
}
