}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{AccurateGLM} object.}

\item{vars}{An integer or character vectors (indices or names) specifying which variables should be plotted.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, outputs details.}

\item{s}{A numeric value specifying lambda value at which plotting is required.
Note that this function can't plot for multiple lambda values, so it allows only
single \code{s} value (which means \code{model} is trained with multiple lambda values and plot with one of them),
or \code{s=NULL} (which means \code{model} is trained with single lambda value and plot with that value).}

\item{resid}{A logical value which indicates to plot residuals,
or a character value which indicates residual type to be plotted (see the help of \code{residuals.AccurateGLM()}),
or a numerical vector which indicates residual values to be plotted.
Note that working residuals are used in the first case with \code{resid=TRUE}.}

\item{smooth_resid}{A logical value which indicates whether draws smoothing lines of residuals or not,
or a character value which is one of options below:
* \code{"both"} draws both balls and smoothing lines.
* \code{"smooth_only"} draws only smoothing line.
Note that smoothing lines are only drawn for quantitative variables.
The default value is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{smooth_resid_fun}{A function to be used to smooth partial residual values.}

\item{ask}{A logical value which indicates ask if go to next plot.}

\item{layout}{A pair of integer values which indicates how many plots are drawn row-wise and column-wise respectively,}

\item{only_plot}{If \code{TRUE}, the function set no graphical parameters and no title.}

\item{main}{A character value which indicates titles of panels.}

\item{add_rug}{A logical value which indicates draw rug plot for quantitative variables.}

\item{...}{Other arguments are currently not used.}
