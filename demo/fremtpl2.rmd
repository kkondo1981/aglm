# What is the data?

The 'freMTPL2' dataset in the 'CASdatasets' package.

```
French Motor Third-Part Liability datasets
Description
In the two datasets freMTPLfreq, freMTPLsev, risk features are collected for 413,169 motor third-part liability policies (observed mostly on one year). In addition, we have claim numbers by policy as well as the corresponding claim amounts. freMTPLfreq contains the risk features and the claim number while freMTPLsev contains the claim amount and the corresponding policy ID.

In the two datasets freMTPL2freq, freMTPL2sev, risk features are collected for 677,991 motor third-part liability policies (observed mostly on one year). In addition, we have claim numbers by policy as well as the corresponding claim amounts. freMTPL2freq contains the risk features and the claim number while freMTPL2sev contains the claim amount and the corresponding policy ID.

# Read the data

```{r}
library(CASdatasets)
data("freMTPL2freq")
xy <- freMTPL2freq

xy <- xy[-1]  # Discard policy ID's we don't use.
xy$ClaimNb <- as.integer(xy$ClaimNb)  # Because it has `table` type by default.
xy$VehGas <- factor(xy$VehGas)  # Convert strings into factor values.
xy$Area <- ordered(xy$Area)  # Convert them into ordered factor values, because this variable has order.
xy$VehBrand <- factor(substr(xy$VehBrand, 1, 2))  # Cut brand names to the first 2 letters, to plot them neatly
xy$Region <- factor(substr(xy$Region, 1, 2))  # same as above

print(dim(xy))

xy <- xy[sample(nrow(xy), 10000), ]  # reduce data size for demo
```

```{r}
y <- xy$ClaimNb
off <- log(xy$Exposure)  # use log(Exposure) as offset
x <- xy[-c(1:2)]  # drop y and off

table(y)
y[y > 4] <- 4  # truncate too large y
```

```{r}
head(x)
```

```{r}
plot(density(off))
```
Note that some values of offset is greater than 0, which means `Exposure > 1 yr`, but we decided to remain them here.
